You can customize most of the styling with the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

The one thing that is currently not configurable is the symbol for newlines.

This plugin is built for the new editor and does not work on the old _legacy_ editor.
If you really want to use the legacy editor you will have to use the [Show whitespace](https://github.com/deathau/cm-show-whitespace-obsidian) plugin.
